	Dictionaries for lexicon-based approaches can be created manually, or automatically. Much of the lexicon-based research has focused on using adjectives
as indicators of the semantic orientation of text. First, a list of adjectives and corresponding semantic orientation values is compiled into a dictionary. Then, for
any given text, all adjectives are extracted and annotated with their semantic orientation value, using the dictionary scores. The semantic orientation scores
 are in turn aggregated into a single score for the text.
	The dictionary is domain specific i.e. the polarities of the words in the dictionary are set according to a specific domain e.g. book reviews, political blogs etc. 
Same word in different domains can have different meanings, the dictionary used in this approach is made for movie review domain. Hence eliminating the 
need for stemming each word which saves more time.
	The Dictionary also contains the strength of the polarity of every word. Some word depicts stronger emotions than others. For example good and 
great are both positive words.
	Negation are very important in identifying the sentiments, as their presence can reverse the polarity of the sentence. The dictionary used 
here also contains various negation words so that they can be identified in the sentence.

Algorithm:
Input: Sentence.
Output : 1or 0.
Step 1: Initialize a posCounter and negCounter to zero.
Step 2: Split sentence into array of words.
Step 3: Check the word against positive and negative word list.
Step 4: If word matches positive word list increment posCounter or if it matches negative word list increment negCounter else skip.
Step 5: Repeat until all words of the sentence are checked against the list.
Step 6: Compare posCouter and negCounter whichever is greater, is the sentiment of the sentence that is positive or negative and return 0 or 1 accordingly.
