AFINN is an affective lexicon by Finn Arup Nielsen. AFINN is a list of English words rated for valence with an integer between minus five (negative) and
 plus five (positive). The words have been manually labeled by Finn Arup Nielsen in 2009-2011. The file is tab-separated. There are two versions:
AFINN-111: Newest version with 2477 words and phrases.
AFINN-96: 1468 unique words and phrases on 1480 lines. Note that there are 1480 lines, as some words are listed twice. The word list in not entirely in 
alphabetic ordering. 
I have used AFINN-111, from http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/6010/zip/imm6010.zip
